# BananHack
The BananHack is an easy way to transform any of your chairs into a rocking chair. The pieces of wood are cut with a laser cut machine. You will also need glue for wood, clamps, and a sander or sander paper for a better finition. Then you will have to drill the top of each part at the right diameter of your chair feet. We also varnish the wood, but you can choose to paint it.
