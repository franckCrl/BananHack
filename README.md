# BananHack
The BananHack is an easy way to transform any of your chairs into a rocking chair. The pieces of wood are cut with a laser cut machine. You will also need glue for wood, clamps, and a sander or sander paper for a better finition. We also varnish the wood, but you can choose to paint it.
